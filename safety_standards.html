        <h2>🚫 Zero Tolerance for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)</h2>
        <p>The Reviewer has a <strong>zero-tolerance policy</strong> regarding Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). We do not tolerate content that sexualizes minors, promotes the exploitation of children, or endangers child safety in any way.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Action Plan:</strong> If we identify any content containing CSAM:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The content will be removed immediately.</li>
            <li>The user account will be permanently banned.</li>
            <li>We will report the content and the user to the <strong>National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)</strong> and relevant law enforcement authorities.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Prohibited Conduct</h2>

        <li><strong>Hate Speech:</strong> Promoting violence or hatred based on race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, age, or sexual orientation.</li>
        <li><strong>Inappropriate Content:</strong> Posting sexually explicit material, nudity, or graphic violence.</li>
        <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> Any attempt by an adult to build an emotional connection with a minor to gain their trust for sexual abuse or exploitation.</li>
